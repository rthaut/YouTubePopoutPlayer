<section id="always-on-top" class="section scrollspy">
    <h4 class="hide">Always on Top</h4>
    <h5><i class="material-icons">question_answer</i> How do I make the popout player always stay on top of other windows?</h5>

    <p>The APIs for browser extensions do not expose any functionality to keep windows on top, so this is not possible through the extension alone (at least for now).</p>

    <p><strong>However</strong>, you can use third-party applications on Windows, like <a class="red-text" href="https://www.autohotkey.com/" rel="nofollow">AutoHotkey</a>, <a class="red-text" href="https://efotinis.neocities.org/deskpins/" rel="nofollow">DeskPins</a>, <a class="red-text" href="https://www.savardsoftware.com/turbotop/" rel="nofollow">TurboTop</a>, or <a class="red-text" href="https://www.displayfusion.com/" rel="nofollow">DisplayFusion</a>. To make this even easier/better, if you are using Firefox, you can use the <a class="red-text" href="{{ '/options#advanced' | relative_url }}">Window Title Text (Preface)</a> setting to add some custom text to the popout player window's title, which you can then use to target the popout player window in these applications.</p>

    <p>For MacOS, you can try using <a class="red-text" href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/mac-keeping-your-application-window-always-on-top/" rel="nofollow">SIMBL + Afloat</a>, though your mileage may vary.</p>

    <p>For Linux, depending on your distribution (and, more likely, your window manager), you probably have a way to set windows to always be on top without the need for additional software.</p>

<section id="data-collection" class="section scrollspy">
    <h4 class="hide">Data Collection</h4>
    <h5><i class="material-icons">question_answer</i> Does this extension collect any of my data/information?</h5>

    <p><strong>No, absolutely not.</strong></p>

    <p>YouTube Popout Player <a class="red-text" href="{{ '/permissions' | relative_url }}">requests permissions</a> to add the controls (button, content menu, etc.) to YouTube videos and to close the original video's window/tab (when you have enabled the "Close Original Window/Tab" option). Permissions for browsers are still very generic, so the permissions needed to do these simple things can also do much more. Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox report these permissions differently (when you install or update the extension), but their descriptions are not very accurate for what YouTube Popout Player actually uses them for.</p>

<section id="video-unavailable" class="section scrollspy">
    <h4 class="hide">Video Unavailable</h4>
    <h5><i class="material-icons">question_answer</i> Why do some videos say "Video unavailable" when opened in the popout player?</h5>

    <p>The popout player uses YouTube's <a class="red-text" href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters" rel="nofollow">embedded video player</a>. By default, all videos uploaded to YouTube can be used in the embedded video player, but all videos can be <a class="red-text" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6301625" rel="nofollow">restricted from being able to be embedded</a>. This means that the owner of the video has intentionally blocked the video from the embedded player, and, as such, it cannot be played through the popout player.</p>
