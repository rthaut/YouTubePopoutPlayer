 * Firefox-Specific Overrides
 * Note: these are applied to all browsers, but should match the computed values when rendered outside the Add-ons Manager
 * TODO: Ensure this is only used for Firefox. Ideas include:
 *   - modifying the build process to only include it for FF
 *   - finding a selector that is only present in Firefox when the Options page is rendered inside the Add-ons Manager
 *   - using JS to add a custom body/html class for Firefox (ideally only when inside the Add-ons Manager)
